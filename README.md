# Scientific Programming 2022

This is the home page for the Scientific programming course.  There is
also the [moodle
page](https://www.vle.cam.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=245192) but I will
tend to update this page more often.  You will need the moodle site
mostly for assignment submissions.

Live lectures will be held on Teams in the [MATHS_MPhil Computational
Biology
2022-23](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3aU0VPMLHT0yG1SaFT4ii-ZHZfp8hP9jeqa3FOVZ*1Ics1%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=dc32d844-7363-4ffe-9d88-914f976d5318&tenantId=49a50445-bdfa-4b79-ade3-547b4f3986e9)
channel, and recorded.  Recordings of lectures are
available in the [Files](https://universityofcambridgecloud.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/DAMTP*MPhilinComputationalBiologyTeam2022-23/Shared%20Documents/Scientific%20Programming%202022/Recordings?csf=1&web=1&e=9kOVvg) area of the channel.

## Consent for recordings

Live lectures will be recorded, and we assume that if you have your
camera or microphone on, then you consent to being recorded.  If you
wish to revoke your consent, please contact us and we will need to
edit you out of the recording.

[Julia material](https://github.com/Nick-Gale/2022_Scientific_Programming_CamCompBio/)

To run through the [Jupyter
installation](https://github.com/Nick-Gale/2022_Scientific_Programming_CamCompBio/blob/main/install_julia.md).

[Julia 1](https://github.com/Nick-Gale/2022_Scientific_Programming_CamCompBio/blob/main/Lectures/lecture1.pdf) was covered in live lecture 13. (SP-13)

[Julia 2](https://github.com/Nick-Gale/2022_Scientific_Programming_CamCompBio/blob/main/Lectures/lecture2.pdf) was pre-recorded and is
[available](https://universityofcambridgecloud.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/sites/DAMTP_MPhilinComputationalBiologyTeam2022-23/Shared%20Documents/Scientific%20Programming%202022/Recordings/SP-13-Julia-lec2.mp4?csf=1&web=1&e=Xwl0UQ)  (SP-13-Julia-lec2)

## Assignments

Three.  Assignments to be submitted to moodle.

[Assignment 1](assigns/a1/spa1-2022.pdf)

[Assignment 2](assigns/a2/spa2-2022.pdf)

[Assignment 3](assigns/a3/spa3-2022.pdf)

<!-- To help with assignment 2, here is a way to include your R code -->
<!-- functions in an appendix, rather than in the main body of the report. -->
<!-- It relies on giving your code chunks names.  See [test.Rnw](test.Rnw) -->
<!-- and [test.pdf](test.pdf). -->


## Examples classes

Examples classes to be led by Max Niroomand (three sessions).
The format of these is quite open ended currently, but please bring
your laptop if you have any issues with running R on your machine.



## LaTeX

I have a pre-recorded
[video](https://universityofcambridgecloud.sharepoint.com/:v:/s/DAMTP_MPhilinComputationalBiologyTeam2022-23/Eaj9OG815bRPnHsmMustVNYBiRFfGefVCgCdskB7Mu7Dfw?e=8rOSgN)
(from 2020) on LaTeX (available only to .cam.ac.uk users).  It is a one-hour
introduction for those who are new to LaTeX, and follows [these
slides](https://github.com/sje30/latex101).  After that, you might
wish to write your own template report following [the texintro
example](https://github.com/sje30/texintro).
