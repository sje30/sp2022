# Scientific Programming 2021

This is the home page for the Scientific programming course.  There is
also the [moodle
page](https://www.vle.cam.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=228882) but I will
tend to update this page more often.

Live lectures will be held on Teams in the "MATHS_MPhil Computational
Biology 2021-22"channel , and recorded.  Recordings are available on
[Panopto](https://cambridgelectures.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=3c6afa11-8d52-45f2-9b38-adb00100a1a0).

## Consent for recordings

Live lectures will be recorded, and we assume that if you have your
camera or microphone on, then you consent to being recorded.  If you
wish to revoke your consent, please contact us and we will need to
edit you out of the recording.

https://education.github.com/pack to ensure you get the 'Pro' features
like private repositories.

To cover: version control, markdown, issues, '.', binder.

See: [github](github) folder for materials, and for the final
repository, see https://github.com/sje30/darts

Recommendation from class for 'github desktop' client
https://desktop.github.com/ to ease use of working with github.

Assignment 3 to be handed out.

## Assignments

Three to follow.  Assignments to be submitted to moodle.


[Assignment 1](assigns/spa1-2021.pdf)

[Assignment 2](assigns/spa2-2021.pdf)

[Assignment 3](assigns/spa3-2021.pdf)

To help with assignment 2, here is a way to include your R code
functions in an appendix, rather than in the main body of the report.
It relies on giving your code chunks names.  See [test.Rnw](test.Rnw)
and [test.pdf](test.pdf).


## Examples classes

Examples classes to be led by Max Niroomand, 19 Oct, 26 Oct, 2 Nov.
The format of these is quite open ended currently, but please bring
your laptop if you have any issues with running R on your machine.
